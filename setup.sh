# setup.sh â€” PeerCache Session Setup Script
#
# Description:
#   Prepares the current terminal session by defining a command `peercache`
#   that runs your peer-to-peer simulation script (`main.py`).
#   This works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via Git Bash or WSL),
#   and supports POSIX-compliant shells like Bash, Zsh, and Dash.
#
# Usage:
#   source setup.sh
#
# Notes:
#   - Do NOT run with `bash setup.sh`; instead, use `source setup.sh` to persist the function.
#   - This script is shell-agnostic but assumes Python 3 is installed and accessible.
